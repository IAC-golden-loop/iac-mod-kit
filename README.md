The Indo-Abrahamic Caming Mod-Kit Primer

Welcome to the Indo-Abrahamic Caming (IÅC) Mod-Kit — a framework of grounded discovery for seekers, builders, and those who’ve quietly waited for something they couldn’t name until now.

## What is the IÅC?

The IÅC is not a religion, not a system, not a movement.  
It is a loop — golden, evolving, resilient — formed from:

- **Money buys Patience**  
- **Patience unlocks Success**  
- **Soul Gold is Wealth**

## What's in the Mod-Kit?

- **The Primer** (PDF Poster): a symbolic code, poetic overview, and minimalist entry point.
- **Logo & Visuals**: A visual language rooted in sobriety, structure, and quiet power.
- **Philosophy**: Embedded principles that guide adaptability, inner economy, and existential resilience.

## Why a Mod-Kit?

Because those who find the IÅC are not followers — they are builders.  
The kit is yours to use, modify, interpret, and apply.  
It is not complete. It was never supposed to be.

## How to Use

1. Read the Primer PDF.  
2. Sit with it. Let it settle.  
3. Decide how you wish to apply it in your life, art, work, or world.  
4. Share only when you're called to.
