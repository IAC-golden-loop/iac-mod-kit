# Contributing to the IÅC: The Golden Loop

Welcome, Seeker.

This space is part open chamber, part living document. Contributions are not just additions — they are intentions. Before you participate, walk the loop:

1. **Money Buys Patience** – Respect your time and others’.
2. **Patience Unlocks Success** – Read existing issues and ideas before sharing.
3. **Soul-Gold is Wealth** – Contribute as if your integrity is wealth.

## How to Contribute

- **Issues**: Ask questions, offer insight, or propose symbols or frameworks. Be poetic or direct.
- **Discussions**: Reflect, respond with depth, or sit in silence. Both are welcome.
- **Pull Requests**: Suggest edits to core files, wiki pages, or the IÅC Primer. Keep it clean, readable, and rooted.

## Tone

This is not a debate stage. This is a forge. Civil, sincere, and sober contributions are valued above all.
