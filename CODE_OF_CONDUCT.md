# IÅC Code of Conduct

The IÅC chamber is a reflection pool, not a battlefield.

## Our Commitments

We commit to:
- Treat all who enter with curiosity and care.
- Reject dismissive, one-word replies that cut off thought.
- Encourage generative contribution — offerings that inspire the next movement.

## Unwelcome Conduct

- Harassment, trolling, or tone-policing.
- Posting in bad faith or to stifle discussion.
- Refusing to walk the loop (see CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Moderation

Early-stage moderation is active. Comments that deaden participation — even subtly — may be removed to preserve the chamber’s resonance.

This chamber is not open to all, but it is open to the ready.
